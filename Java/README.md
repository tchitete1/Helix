# Helix

Helix is a Command-Line program written in Java which identifies a person based on a sample of their DNA profile.

## Description

The program works by analysing Short Tandem Repeats (STRs)â€“short sequences of DNA bases present in a person's DNA which
tend to repeat. Helix reads a user-specified DNA sequence along with a CSV file containing STR counts for various individuals
into memory. Ultimately, the program obtains the counts of various STRs present in the DNA and if they match to a person in
the database, the name of the matching individual will be output to the terminal, otherwise, "No Match" will be output instead. 

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install the ```helix``` archive by downloading [```helix-master.zip```](https://github.com/tchitete1/helix/archive/master.zip)
2. Open a new terminal window in the directory where the archive was downloaded
3. Unzip the archive using the following command to obtain the ```helix-master``` directory:
```
unzip helix-master.zip
```
4. Delete the archive using the following command:
```
rm helix-master.zip
```
5. Change into the ```helix-master/Java``` directory by executing the following command:
```
cd helix-master/Java
```
### Compilation

* To compile ```Helix```, execute the following:
```
javac *.java
```

### Execution

* To execute ```Helix```, execute the following:
```
java Helix <database> <sequence>
```
where ```database``` is one of the databases storing the STR counts of different individuals, located in the ```Databases``` 
directory and ```sequence``` is the DNA sequence we seek to analyse to determine a match, located in the ```Sequences``` directory. For example,
```
java Helix Databases/Large.csv Sequences/9.txt
```
The expected output for the above is ```Draco```.

### Restoration

* To restore the ```helix-master``` directory back to its original state, execute the following:
```
rm *.class
```
